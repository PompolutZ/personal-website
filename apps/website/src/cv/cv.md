## Summary

I'm passionate about programming and building interesting, maintainable products. I enjoy taking ideas from a napkin sketch to the end user. With 15+ years of professional experience, I thrive on turning complex challenges into polished, user-centric solutions.

## Experience

- Full-stack developer on a product with two main apps — a `React` web app and a `React Native` mobile app — powered by 30+ `REST` and `RPC` `microservices` and a monolith on `AWS`, using `MySQL`, `DynamoDB`, and `PostgreSQL`.  
- Led multiple initiatives, e.g., developed a custom authentication library supporting Mobile `BankID`, `Cognito`, `Passkeys`, etc., used across all apps as a single source of truth. Standardized `ESLint` and `Prettier` setups company-wide to enforce common styles and improve maintainability.  
- Actively contributing to internal engineering discussions and RFCs, mentoring junior colleagues.

### Tobii AB, Stockholm

- Member of the SDK team, developing a reactive library to simplify eye-tracking integration.  
- Built several web products using `Angular`, `React`, `jQuery`, and `Django`.

### Earlier Experience in Kyiv - Kuadriga, Ciklum, GlobalLogic

## In my free time

When I’m tired of programming — which is also my hobby — or don’t need to do parenting, I enjoy miniature painting, board games, and long walks in the forest.
