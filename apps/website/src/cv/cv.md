## Summary

I am passionate about programming and building interesting, maintainable projects. I enjoy the full cycle of bringing an idea from napkin or board to the end user. I've been doing this professionally for almost 15 years. If numbers mean anything, I know a thing or two. And I am confident in getting a project to the finish line.

We have a long history with this guy, but it is used, at least used to be, but about 100+ users per day, which for a home sandbox sounds like great success. Nothing to brag about, but some ideas there I really enjoyed :)
