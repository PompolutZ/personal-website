# CV Page Implementation Summary

## âœ… Implementation Complete

I've successfully implemented a CV page for your personal website with PDF download capability. Here's what was created:

### Files Created

1. **`src/cv/cv.md`** - Your CV content in markdown format with frontmatter
   - Contains all your professional information
   - Easy to edit and maintain
   - Structured with frontmatter metadata (name, title, contact info)

2. **`build-cv.ts`** - CV builder that processes the markdown file
   - Parses frontmatter and markdown content
   - Generates `dist/cv/cv.json` for consumption by the app
   - Runs automatically during build and dev

3. **`src/pages/CV.tsx`** - React-like component to render the CV
   - Fetches CV data from the generated JSON
   - Displays professional layout
   - Includes "Download PDF" button
   - Uses your custom framework

4. **`src/cv/cv-styles.css`** - Professional styling with print optimization
   - Beautiful on-screen presentation
   - Print-optimized CSS with `@media print` queries
   - Handles page breaks properly
   - Professional PDF output
   - Responsive design for mobile

5. **`vite-cv-plugin.ts`** - Vite plugin to handle CV routes
   - Serves CV JSON in development
   - Builds CV during production build
   - Similar pattern to your blog plugin

### Files Modified

1. **`src/main.tsx`**
   - Added CV route (`/cv`)
   - Imported CV component and styles
   - Integrated into routing logic

2. **`src/pages/Home.tsx`**
   - Added CV link to navigation

3. **`vite.config.ts`**
   - Integrated CV plugin
   - CV builds automatically with the project

## How It Works

1. **Development**: When you run `pnpm dev`, the CV builder processes `cv.md` and generates `cv.json`
2. **Viewing**: Navigate to `/cv` to see your CV
3. **PDF Download**: Click the "Download PDF" button to print/save as PDF
4. **Editing**: Simply edit `src/cv/cv.md` to update your CV
