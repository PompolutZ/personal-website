Perfect! I've created a comprehensive plan for building your CV page. Here's the approach:

Plan Overview
Create CV markdown file - Store your CV content in markdown format with frontmatter metadata
Build CV parser - Similar to your blog builder, process the markdown into structured data
Create CV component - Render the CV beautifully using your custom framework
Add print-optimized CSS - Ensure it looks professional when printed/saved as PDF
Implement PDF download - Add a button that triggers browser print for PDF generation
Add routing - Integrate the CV page into your app navigation
Update build process - Include CV generation in your build pipeline
The solution will:

✅ Use markdown for easy content editing
✅ Look beautiful and professional on screen
✅ Be downloadable as PDF via browser print
✅ Follow your existing architecture patterns
✅ Work seamlessly with your custom framework
Would you like me to proceed with implementing this plan? I'll create all the necessary files and integrate them into your existing structure.

We have a long history with this guy, but it is used, at least used to be, but about 100+ users per day, which for a home sandbox sounds like
great success. Nothing to brag about, but some ideas there I really enjoyed :)
